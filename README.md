# schedulingPoliciesAnalysis  
This small project was create to analyze the effects of cloudlet and VM scheduling policies on cloudlet processing time.  
Using the CloudSim simulation toolkit to perform performance analysis on the cloud simulation.   
In this Project, We analyze the effects of using combinations of different cloudlet and VM scheduling policies, namely:  

•	CloudletSchedulerTimeShared()   
•	CloudletSchedulerSpaceShared()   
•	VmSchedulerTimeShared()  
•	VmSchedulerSpaceShared()
